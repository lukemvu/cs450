I was only able to complete min-cost-naive through an iterative method by tracking on an index k and the lengths of lists I was working with. Originally I started the solution trying to follow the pseudo code. I could not find a way iterate through each key of the list. I built functions to split the list, sum the weight, find min value of a list, and one to apply the procedure list-sum that attempted to return a list of computed weight-sums that my main function could pull the min from. I was trying to use the map procedure to apply this list-sum procedure onto all the values of the list but realized this was just passing the list of key weights to the function. I was hard stuck here and ended up scrapping this and coding the solution with an iterative approach. This allowed a way to traverse through the list of lists. min-cost-naive-iter takes the list, an index, and a min value. An additional base case returned the min val once all key weight pairs were iterated through. \\

I gave myself a full three days to work on the assignment and this was as far as I was able to make it. I regret not just skipping over task 1 and starting the other tasks.
