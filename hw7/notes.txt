pt2

Started by following the save_continuation.scm. Inserted call/cc procedure into my 450 loop and a call to target in error portions. This worked. (s450error) returne back to the s450 loop and displays an error msg with arguments that were passed that failed.

test with eof button
test with unbound variables to see if they would return

test with direct (exit)  in the s450 prompt

some issues with #<void> appearing, realized it was comign from user defined procedures printing object? i think. suncharn suggested editing this

pt1 delayed

started with some procedures delayed delayed? thunk? tuhnk-exp and thunk-env mostly from book code

make thunks in the list of values area

;;; Handling procedure arguments
(define (list-of-values exps env)
  (if (no-operands? exps)
      '()
      (cond ((delayed? (first-operand exps))
             (display "inside delayed")
             (cons (make-thunk (cdar exps) env) (list-of-values (rest-operands exps) env)))
            (else
             (display "reached else")
             (cons (xeval (first-operand exps) env)
                   (list-of-values (rest-operands exps) env))))))

Some issue here, not reaching else properly.

trying an installation as a special form
